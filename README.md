This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter template that includes basic configurations and structure to help you get started quickly. But it's quite opinionated since it used my own configuration presets, so feel free to customize it to your needs.

## What's Included

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- TailwindCSS v4
- TypeScript
- Shadcn UI
- Prettier
- ESLint

## Usage Guide

1. Install dependencies using bun:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
4. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   bun run start
   ```

First, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
